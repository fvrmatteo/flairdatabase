The **Public IDA FLAIR signature database** is a public effort to create a repository of FLAIR signatures.

[IDA Pro](http://www.hex-rays.com/idapro/) is the most powerful and most widely used disassembler. IDA includes a feature called FLIRT (Fast Library Identification and Recognition Technology) which "encompasses the set of techniques employed by IDA to identify sequences of code as library code."<sup>(1)</sup> FLIRT signatures can be created using the FLAIR (Fast Library Acquisition for Identification and Recognition) tool distributed by Hex-Rays.

This project is an attempt at coordinating a community-created repository of IDA FLIRT signatures.
